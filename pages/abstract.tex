Prescribing medicine to patients is a complex task that involves risks.
This challenge continuously increases with the growing choice of
medications, pharmaceutical knowledge and an increasingly elderly
population. Precision Medicine is an emerging approach to pharmaceutical
treatment that considers the individual's health in contrast to a
one-size-fits-all approach. Recommender Systems are a great tool that
could analyse a patient's health status and help clinicians choose
prescriptions. This project looks into the existing approaches researchers
have been using for building medicine recommenders and the type of data
being used to produce a system that uses more data like demographics and
produces safer and more accurate results.
