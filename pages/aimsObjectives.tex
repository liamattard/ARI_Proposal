\label{AimObjectives}
The new era of precision medicine brings forward systems that can work
hand in hand with clinicians by personalising the patient's results and
preventing medication errors. This project aims to build a health RS that
uses a person's current state and past medical history (demographics,
diagnosis, and physiologic data) to recommend a set of personalised
medications from an EHR. We will try to answer the following research
question:

\begin{center}
    \textit{
        Can personalised recommendations suggest medicine for patients?
    }
\end{center}

%\subsection{Aim}

We form the following objectives to achieve our aim:

\begin{itemize}

    \item Address cold start issues when introducing new patients.

     \item Find the best model suited for all possible scenarios.

    \item Make sure that any pair of recommended medicine does not
        cause any adverse side effects with each other.

    \item 
        Determine important features in the EHR that hold the most value
        when predicting medicine to patients.

\end{itemize}
