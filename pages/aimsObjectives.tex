The new era of precision medicine brings forward systems
that can work hand in hand with clinicians by
personalising the patient's results and preventing
medication errors. However, health RSs come with both an
opportunity and a challenge.

\subsection{Aim}
This proposed project aims to build a health RS that
uses a person's current state to recommend a set of
personalised medications from an EHR.

\subsection{Objectives}
We form the following objectives to achieve our aim:

\begin{itemize}

    \item 
         The first objective is to address cold start
         issues when introducing new patients and find
         the best model suited for all possible
         scenarios.

    \item 
        The second objective is to aggregate the EHR
        dataset with a drug interactions dataset
        containing information about a specific
        medication and its effects and conflicts with
        other drugs. This combination ensures that any
        recommended medicine does not cause harm or
        damaging side effects to any patients.

    \item 
        The third objective is to determine which data
        in the EHR holds the most value when predicting
        medicine to patients.

\end{itemize}
