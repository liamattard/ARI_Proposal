With over 20,000 prescription-only FDA approved medications,
doctors may face a challenge when prescribing medicine to a
specific patient. Unfortunately, the FDA receives more than
100,000 declarations of medication errors each year in the United
States alone \cite{FDA2021}. Modern hospitals use Electronic
Health Records (EHR) to keep track of everything and deal with
this complexity \cite{Kim2019}. 

EHRs are a collection of clinical information gathered
from health care patients. The mass adoption of such
systems deliver a large amount of data compiled on a
patient's demographics, diagnosed conditions, medical
prescriptions, procedures and any health-related history
\cite{Kim2019}.

This data provides opportunities for machine learning systems to improve and
automate clinical care practices, for example, early disease detection and
identifying patients at high risk of severe conditions
\cite{10.2307/20720782, Juhn2019}.

This data provides opportunities for machine learning systems,
such as Recommender Systems (RS) to automate a particular
hospital procedures. For example, A system that suggests a list
of medicine based on a patient's current tate, will serve as an
important decision-support tool for medical experts to assist
with patient prescriptions \cite{Bhoi2021}.
