With over 20,000 prescription-only FDA approved
medications \cite{Sun}, doctors may face a challenge when
prescribing medicine to a specific patient.
Unfortunately, the FDA receives more than 100,000
declarations of medication errors each year in the
United States alone. Modern hospitals use Electronic
Health Records (EHR) to keep track of everything and
deal with this complexity. 

EHR are a collection of clinical information gathered
from health care patients. The mass adoption of such
systems delivers a large amount of data compiled on a
patient's diagnosed conditions, medical prescriptions,
procedures and any health-related history.

This data provides opportunities for machine learning
systems, such as Recommender Systems (RS), to aid
medical experts in prescribing personalised medication
for each patient.
